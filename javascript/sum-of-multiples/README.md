# Sum Of Multiples

Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or
5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Allow the program to be configured to find the sum of multiples of
numbers other than 3 and 5.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ jasmine-node .
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
